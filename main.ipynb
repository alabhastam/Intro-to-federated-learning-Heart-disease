What is Federated Learning?</h2>\n","  <p>\n","    Federated Learning (FL) is a <b>decentralized machine learning approach</b> where multiple devices or organizations collaboratively train a model without sharing their raw data. Instead of sending data to a central server, each participant trains a local model and only shares model updates.\n","  </p>\n","  <p>\n","    Think of it as many chefs cooking in their own kitchens, but sharing only their <i>recipe improvements</i> — not the secret ingredients.\n","  </p>\n","  \n","  <h2 style=\"color:#FFD700;\">2. Why is Federated Learning Important?</h2>\n","  <ul>\n","    <li>✅ <b>Privacy Preservation:</b> Sensitive data never leaves the local device.</li>\n","    <li>✅ <b>Reduced Data Transfer:</b> Only model parameters/gradients are exchanged.</li>\n","    <li>✅ <b>Regulatory Compliance:</b> Helps meet GDPR, HIPAA, and similar regulations.</li>\n","    <li>✅ <b>Edge Computing:</b> Utilizes data and compute resources at the source.</li>\n","  </ul>\n","  \n","  <h2 style=\"color:#FFD700;\">3. How Does It Work?</h2>\n","  <ol>\n","    <li>📤 <b>Server sends initial model</b> to all participants.</li>\n","    <li>🖥️ <b>Local training</b> happens on each participant's private data.</li>\n","    <li>📥 <b>Local model updates</b> are sent back to the server.</li>\n","    <li>🔄 <b>Aggregation</b> (e.g., FedAvg algorithm) combines updates into a global model.</li>\n","    <li>🔁 Repeat until the model converges.</li>\n","  </ol>\n","  \n","  <h2 style=\"color:#FFD700;\">4. Real-World Example</h2>\n","  <p>\n","    Google’s <b>Gboard keyboard</b> uses Federated Learning to improve text prediction:\n","    your typed messages stay on your device, while only the learned model changes are sent\n","    to improve the shared model.\n","  </p>\n","  \n","  <h2 style=\"color:#FFD700;\">5. Key Challenges</h2>\n","  <ul>\n","    <li>⚠️ <b>Non-IID Data:</b> Data distributions differ across participants.</li>\n","    <li>⚠️ <b>Network Reliability:</b> Communication delays affect training speed.</li>\n","    <li>⚠️ <b>Security:</b> Model updates can still leak sensitive patterns.</li>\n","    <li>⚠️ <b>Client Coordination:</b> Handling dropped or slow clients is tricky.</li>\n","  </ul>\n","  \n","  <h2 style=\"color:#FFD700;\">6.
